<h3 align="center">A hobby developer.</h3>

- 🔭 I've created Applications, Mods, Games and Websites. I particularly enjoy working with C# and PHP.

- ⚡ I’m always working on projects behind the scene. I tend to loose interest pretty fast sometimes...

- 👨‍💻 Most of my projects are available [here](https://github.com/n0tic?tab=repositories).

- 📫 You can reach me on Discord: [**N0tiC#0694**](https://discord.gg/WypdXXJ34p)
